**Live Attendance Project**

This project is a CS50 final project aimed at automating attendance tracking using machine learning to identify faces in real-time.

**Overview**

The Live Attendance Project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize faces captured by a camera feed.
It provides a streamlined solution for attendance management, eliminating the need for manual roll calls or sign-ins.
This project offers a user-friendly interface for both administrators and participants, ensuring smooth operation and accurate attendance records.

**Features**
* Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes machine learning models to detect faces in a live camera feed.
* Face Recognition: Matches detected faces with pre-registered individuals to accurately identify attendees.
* Attendance Logging: Automatically records attendance in a CSV file.

**Usage**
Registration: 
* Administrators should register individuals by capturing their faces and providing necessary details such as name, ID, etc.
Start Attendance Session:
* Start the attendance session to begin detecting and recognizing faces in real-time.
View Attendance:
* Administrators can view attendance logs either through the interface or by accessing the generated CSV file.
  
**Dependencies**
* OpenCV: For capturing and processing video feeds.
* FaceRecognition: For face recognition
